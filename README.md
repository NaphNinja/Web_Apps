# Web_Apps
These are mostly here to update and improve my back-end software skills with languages and tools such as Python, Ruby on Rails and Kubernetes

- Libfreenect Installer for configuring and building dependencies required for Libfreenect2 packages on an ARM architecture.
- ROS GUI to implement a QT based graphical user interface when using tools such as Rviz and image_viewer for visualization applications regarding Lidars etc.
- ROS QT ez publisher for implementing a ROS topic and subscriber node. This is experimental as it aims to automate the publisher and subscriber process for visualization.
- Ruby on Rails application to handle and implement functionality towards webcrunch services such as screencast etc.
